 abstract = {A novel remote ventilator management (control) technology (Omnitool) was implemented for use with ICU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate in-person respiratory therapist interactions and preserve personal protective equipment. In the latter half of 2020, eight mechanical ventilators were purchased and enabled for Omnitool deployment through the application of a vendor software option. Subsequently, these ventilators were outfitted with commercially available informatics hardware that permitted remote communication and management via the existing hospital network.  In total, 17 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure were placed on Omnitool enabled ventilators between January 1, 2021-April 30, 2021. The median Omnitool use days was 10. Deployment of a novel remote ventilator management technology is feasible; however, further study is needed to simplify the set up and utilization of the system. Future demands for remote ventilator management, whether in rural areas or military scenarios without adequate RT staffing, or in circumstances with new and easily transmissible toxic infections, are predictable and will continue to encourage the development of relatively easy to apply informatics-based solutions.},
