abstract: A novel remote ventilator management (control) technology (Omnitool) was
  implemented for use with ICU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic to mitigate in-person
  respiratory therapist interactions and preserve personal protective equipment. In
  the latter half of 2020, eight mechanical ventilators were purchased and enabled
  for Omnitool deployment through the application of a vendor software option. Subsequently,
  these ventilators were outfitted with commercially available informatics hardware
  that permitted remote communication and management via the existing hospital network.  In
  total, 17 patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure were placed on Omnitool enabled
  ventilators between January 1, 2021-April 30, 2021. The median Omnitool use days
  was 10. Deployment of a novel remote ventilator management technology is feasible;
  however, further study is needed to simplify the set up and utilization of the system.
  Future demands for remote ventilator management, whether in rural areas or military
  scenarios without adequate RT staffing, or in circumstances with new and easily
  transmissible toxic infections, are predictable and will continue to encourage the
  development of relatively easy to apply informatics-based solutions.
