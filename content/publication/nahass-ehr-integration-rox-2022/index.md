abstract: 'Introduction/Hypothesis: The ROX indices offer clinicians an objective
  assessment of respiratory status while on high flow nasal cannula (HFNC). In the
  ongoing COVID pandemic these scores can provide a specific pathway for alerting
  teams of impending respiratory decline. The scores use SpO2, FiO2, respiratory and
  heart rates in a ratio that are trended to identify deterioration. Leveraging data
  within the electronic health record (EHR) can alleviate clinician workload and guarantee
  uniformity in measurements and timing. We describe the IT implementation of auto-calculation
  of ROX indices for patients on HFNC. Methods: Critical care physicians & advanced
  practice providers, hospitalists, step-down nursing staff, and respiratory therapists
  were identified as key stakeholders who would care for COIVD patients and were given
  a brief in-service of the indices. Accuracy of key elements were reviewed with staff
  to ensure proper timing and measurement. Working with the EHR IT team, calculated
  fields for the ROX indices were developed and incorporated into the vital sign flowsheet
  for all COVID patients who were started on HFNC. Implementation data was collected
  from 2/16 - 7/28/21. Results: Upon initiation of HFNC, ROX indices scores are automatically
  calculated and recalculated each time vital signs are taken every two hours. If
  the ROX-HR is below 6.88 or the ROX is below 4.88, a critical downward arrow appears
  next to the numerical value. During the implementation period 12 COVID patients
  were placed on HFNC, 588 of both ROX indices were calculated and of these there
  were 262 ROX-HR and 89 ROX scores deemed as critical. After reaching critical values,
  clinicians are able to activate a pathway to escalate the level of care. Conclusions:  Implementation
  of the ROX indices into the EHR was feasible and can assist clinicians in detecting
  patients at higher risk of respiratory failure. During the COVID pandemic, monitoring
  these scores from the EHR can objectively assess respiratory status and possibly
  improve patient safety by earlier recognition of respiratory decompensation and
  expedite escalation of care. Further studies are needed to review the outcomes of
  patients monitored through these scores for morbidity and mortality.'
