 abstract = {Objectives: To describe the design and implementation of the ``ICU Census'', a custom logistical and clinical data platform for a Critical Care Center.  Methods: The Census is composed of an ASP.NET frontend, middleware of three .NET Windows Services and a connection to the hospital's Rhapsody Integration Engine, and an MS SQL database and MS SSRS reporting server backend. The currently evolving version was deployed in 2015. We analyzed 2021 data, focusing on the automated requests by our middleware services, user login data (view-only and interactive sessions), user interface data, and clinical measures from our oncologic ICU.  Results: During the study period, the middleware services issued 21,112 automated requests. Use of the program was evenly split between view-only and interactive sessions; users logged 343,656 minutes on the platform. The front end is made up of 1,585 discrete data fields (fully automated 48%, manual 20% and both 32%). Our platform tracked 3,246 Consults and 2,567 rapid response calls. The Census followed 1,092 ICU admissions from 7 departments and 34 hospital services undergoing 2,507 procedures and 848 transports and automatically generated and emailed to ICU staff 1,147 aggregated daily ICU rounding PDF reports with administrative and organ systems based clinical data and 2,567 rapid response summaries. The Census distributes data to ICU central and bedside Greaseboards and produces real-time Tableau Dashboards and other standard and customizable reports.  Conclusion: Our ICU is effectively managed through the ICU Census, producing patient and aggregate data not available from the EHR or other hospital systems.},
