abstract: "Objectives: To describe the design and implementation of the ``ICU Census'',\
  \ a custom logistical and clinical data platform for a Critical Care Center.  Methods:\
  \ The Census is composed of an ASP.NET frontend, middleware of three .NET Windows\
  \ Services and a connection to the hospital's Rhapsody Integration Engine, and an\
  \ MS SQL database and MS SSRS reporting server backend. The currently evolving version\
  \ was deployed in 2015. We analyzed 2021 data, focusing on the automated requests\
  \ by our middleware services, user login data (view-only and interactive sessions),\
  \ user interface data, and clinical measures from our oncologic ICU.  Results: During\
  \ the study period, the middleware services issued 21,112 automated requests. Use\
  \ of the program was evenly split between view-only and interactive sessions; users\
  \ logged 343,656 minutes on the platform. The front end is made up of 1,585 discrete\
  \ data fields (fully automated 48%, manual 20% and both 32%). Our platform tracked\
  \ 3,246 Consults and 2,567 rapid response calls. The Census followed 1,092 ICU admissions\
  \ from 7 departments and 34 hospital services undergoing 2,507 procedures and 848\
  \ transports and automatically generated and emailed to ICU staff 1,147 aggregated\
  \ daily ICU rounding PDF reports with administrative and organ systems based clinical\
  \ data and 2,567 rapid response summaries. The Census distributes data to ICU central\
  \ and bedside Greaseboards and produces real-time Tableau Dashboards and other standard\
  \ and customizable reports.  Conclusion: Our ICU is effectively managed through\
  \ the ICU Census, producing patient and aggregate data not available from the EHR\
  \ or other hospital systems."
