abstract: We present a patient with mitochondrial myopathy who developed rhabdomyolysis
  following treatment with clindamycin. While clindamycin is not yet linked to drug-induced
  rhabdomyolysis in the literature, other drugs with mechanisms of action similar
  to clindamycin have been shown to damage human host mitochondria. Given this, we
  contend that clindamycin may also be capable of causing mitochondrial injury, and
  that while in otherwise healthy patients it may not produce any negative clinical
  outcome, it can precipitate rhabdomyolysis in certain patients whose mitochondria
  are already vulnerable.
