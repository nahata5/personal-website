abstract: 'Objective: To systematically review the literature pertaining to asynchronous
  automated electronic notifications of laboratory results to clinicians. Methods:
  PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Collaboration were queried for studies
  pertaining to automated electronic notifications of laboratory results. A title
  review was performed on the primary results, with a further abstract review and
  full review to produce the final set of included articles. Results: The full review
  included 34 articles, representing 19 institutions. Of these, 19 reported implementation
  and design of systems, 11 reported quasi-experimental studies, 3 reported a randomized
  controlled trial, and 1 was a meta-analysis. Twenty-seven articles included alerts
  of critical results, while 5 focused on urgent notifications and 2 on elective notifications.
  There was considerable variability in clinical setting, system implementation, and
  results presented. Conclusion: Several asynchronous automated electronic notification
  systems for laboratory results have been evaluated, most from $>$10 years ago. Further
  research on the effect of notifications on clinicians as well as the use of modern
  electronic health records and new methods of notification is warranted to determine
  their effects on workflow and clinical outcomes.'
